Getting Started
=======
Official supported environment for building and running muIR is ubuntu 18.04. You have to run these commands to install required packages from ubuntu package repositories :
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libjsoncpp-dev  libncurses5-dev graphviz binutils-dev
sudo apt-get install gcc-8-multilib g++-8-multilib
````

Build
======

To build muIR dependencies, we have scripted installing the dependencies. To install the dependencies you need only to run the following commands:

``` bash
cd muir
source ./scripts/dandelion.sh
cd ..
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DLLVM_DIR=<your repository>/Tapir-Meta/tapir/build/lib/cmake/llvm/ -DTAPIR=ON ..
make
source ./scripts/setup-env.sh
```

Running tests
===============
Inside test directory there are set of test example which show the generality of dandelion-generator.
To get the generated accelerator files for test cases you can run:

```
# in your code repository
cd build/test/c/
make all
```

For each test case there is going to be one Scala file which has the detailed implementation of dandelion-generator.

How to run generator on your code (detailed way)?
=================================================

For generating `.scala` for your code the following steps need to be taken :

1. Emit the llvm ir (`.ll`) for your code with supported Tapir/muIR compiler(`<your repository code location>/Tapir-Meta/tapir/build/bin/clang`).
    * You can out put llvm ir with this command `./Tapir-Meta/tapir/build/bin/clang -emit-llvm [Your source code]`
2. Run `opt` with `-mem2reg -loop-simplify -loop-simplifycfg -disable-loop-vectorization -dce` arguments on your llvm ir (`.ll`) code.
3. Run TAPAS generator on your `.ll` file like this :
    * `<your repository>/build/bin/dandelion -fn-name=[output file of last step] -config=../../scripts/config.json -o output.scala`

How to run generator on your code (simple way)?
=======
You can simply put your `.c` file in the `<your repository>/test/c` directory and simply run :
```
$ make all
```
After that you should have the `.scala` file beside your `.c` file with a same name.
